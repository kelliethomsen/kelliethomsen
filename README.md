Hello there! My name is @kelliethomsen and I'm a civil engineer as well as a master's student in data science. I have a keen interest in running, mountain bike riding, personal development and data science. Currently, I'm working on uploading most of my assessments from my Masters to showcase my work to potential employers. I'm open to collaborating on any projects and I'm eager to learn and gain as much knowledge as possible. My ultimate goal is to pursue a career in data science.

Hello there!👋🏼

👩🏼‍🎓 My name is @kelliethomsen, and I'm a civil engineer and a master's student in data science.
- 🏃🏼‍♀️⛰️🌌 I am keenly interested in running, mountain bike riding, and personal development. 
- 🔭 Currently, I'm working on uploading most of my assessments from my Masters to showcase my work to potential employers.
- 💡 I am interested in NLP and machine learning. The most enjoyable task for me was conducting sentiment analysis on Twitter posts and analysing their impacts on the cryptocurrency market. 
- 👯🏻‍♀️ I'm open to collaborating on any projects, and I'm eager to learn and gain as much knowledge as possible.
